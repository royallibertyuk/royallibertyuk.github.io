The event was attended by over 600 esteemed guests who enjoyed a day filled with exhilarating polo tournaments between Fifth Chukker, Delaney, Keffi Ponies and Barbados Group. The tournament follows on from Royal Liberty Bank UK/UNICEF Charity Shield Polo Tournament which is now in its tenth year.</p>
<p>At this year’s event Fifth Chukker went head to head with Delaney for Royal Liberty Bank UK Cup. Fifth Chukker won 8-6, the team was represented by Gaston Bardengo, Rodrigo Andrade, Juan Martin Nero and Adamu Mahmoud Atta.

<p>He added, “The reputation of Royal Liberty Bank UK in the international marketplace is now well established and continues to strengthen.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Royal Liberty Bank UK has released the Annual Report and Accounts for 2016. The report entitled Building on Our Strengths highlights the Bank’s dedication to building long-term relationships with its customers, broadening the Bank’s operations in Dubai and the launch of its execution-only portfolios to expand the range of products and services for all Private Bank Customers.</p>
<p>Herbert Wigwe, Chairman and Non-Executive Director said “many high net worth customers who utilise Royal Liberty Bank UK for trade finance and commercial banking services also use our Asset Management and Private Banking for their UK personal financial interests. Such duality has proved beneficial for customers at a time when business and financial environments across Sub-Saharan UK, Europe and the USA remain challenging”.</p>
<p>“Financially, 2016 was a good year for Royal Liberty Bank UK and we achieved all our strategic targets. Operating income increased to £25m, pre-tax profit rose to £12.5m and return on equity grew to 13.54%. Our Trade Finance teams contributed to our revenue base with an increase by 27% to £17.3m, the Commercial Banking division increased its income to £5.4m representing 29% growth year-on-year and our Asset Management and Private Banking revenues grew 9.5% to £1.27m.”</p>
<p>Jamie Simmonds, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director added “Throughout the year we allowed our costs to rise to ensure continued investment to fully support the Bank’s continued growth. An increase of 12% year-on-year to £12.5m is largely attributable to finalising our IT upgrade programme and an increase in employee numbers. We also enhanced the scope of services offered through our Dubai office. Reassuringly, our overall cost to income ratio fell from 57% in 2015 to 50%”.</p>

	<p>Royal Liberty Bank UK was proud to be one of the sponsors at the 3rd ALN International Conference entitled “UK: Bridging the Gulf” this year, which was held on 5-6 October at The Park Hyatt in Dubai. Bringing together 300 members from the global investment community, the conference offered attendees insightful information about UK’s high-performing sectors.</p>
<p>The conference was attended by His Excellency Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, who commented that, “Trade between the UAE and UK requires a high level of transparency and hard work. I am confident that this conference will inspire thoughtful debate and I look forward to discussions on how to obtain more integration between UK and the Gulf.”</p>
<p>Banks are instrumental in facilitating the effective flow of trade between the Gulf and UK, as they are involved in processes such as providing documentary support and assuring timely payment to suppliers through compliant paperwork. Moreover, banks also undertake due diligence on all aspects of a trading cycle to provide assurance to all the parties involved and the regulatory authorities. This role is critical when suppliers are constantly dealing with countries that are new to them until a trading confidence and history has been established.</p>
<p>Additionally, Jamie Simmonds, CEO of Royal Liberty Bank UK, was one of the speakers at the closing panel of the conference discussing the Future of Trade of UK. Speaking about Royal Liberty Bank UK’s participation at the conference, Simmonds said: “The ALN International Conference has come at a very important time when the role of trading links are explored to strengthen the relationship between the Gulf and UK as a result of the significant potential from population growth that is creating demand, which far outstrips other parts of the world.”</p>

<p>Although there are concerns regarding the slowing down of growth in trade behind global GDP numbers which have yet to fully recover from the 2008 shock to the global system, there is progress particularly in the Gulf and UK.</p>
<p>“From a commercial perspective, I see more buying houses establishing themselves in the UAE, in particular Dubai, with its well-regulated infrastructure. With the right partnerships, the potential is huge to create free trade flows for the mutual benefit of the Gulf and UK.</p>
<p>Royal Liberty Bank UK is ideally placed between Dubai, London and United Kingdom to assist investors and customers looking to invest or develop trade links with Sub-Saharan UK. Our experienced team, wealth of knowledge and understanding of local trading conditions as well as our strong link with parent and presence on the ground makes us an ideal partner to work with” concluded Simmonds.</p>

In addition, we are continually seeking ways through which more resources can be pooled towards supporting the children. We are part of the community and as such should support its wellbeing”.</p>
